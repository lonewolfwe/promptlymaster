## Overview

**XML Prompt Builder** is a modern web application designed to help everyday users generate **structured, context-aware XML prompts** for AI. By automatically detecting the intent of plain-English input, the app ensures clearer, more accurate AI responses—reducing hallucinations and improving reliability. No prior XML knowledge is required.

---

## Features

* **Plain-English Input**: Users type natural language prompts.
* **Context-Aware Templates**: Auto-detects intent and dynamically selects or adjusts the XML template.
* **Dual-View Output**:

  * Raw XML output with **copy-to-clipboard**.
  * Friendly summary explaining detected context and template choice.
* **AI Integration**: Sends the structured XML to OpenAI (GPT-4) and displays the generated response.
* **User Accounts**: Email/password login; single-user per account.
* **Prompt History**: Saves a handful of recent XML prompts per user.
* **Friendly Error Handling**: Provides suggestions for correction when input is ambiguous or errors occur.
* **Analytics**: Google Analytics tracks template usage, prompt generation frequency, and user engagement.

## How It Works

1. User types a plain-English prompt in the input box.
2. The app auto-detects the **intent** of the prompt (e.g., summarization, Q&A, translation).
3. The appropriate **XML template** is dynamically applied based on context.
4. The generated XML appears in the **dual-view panel** alongside a plain-English explanation.
5. Optionally, the XML prompt is sent to **OpenAI API**, and the AI’s response is displayed.
6. Users can **copy XML** or save it to their account for later use.
